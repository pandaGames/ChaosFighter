Usage: TEXASM.EXE <res-file>|<wildcard> <output-wildcard> [<task>]



<res-file> - resource script to process.

To be able to locate the resources, texasm.exe must

be run from the folder of the main project executable.


<wildcard> - a wildcard to search image files for processing.

Either <res-file> or <wildcard> should be specified, not both.

All image formats supported by HGE can be handled.


<output-wildcard> - wildcard to store the result to.

For example, "opt_textures\TitleTex" will generate the following files:

  opt_textures\TitleTex1.png, opt_textures\TitleTex1.res

  opt_textures\TitleTex2.png, opt_textures\TitleTex2.res

  ...


<task> - optional resource filter.

If omitted, all resources found in the script/folder will be processed.

The default resgroup assigned to folder resources is 0.

Example tasks:


  2

  Process all resources from resgroup 2


  7+sprFlower/sprLeaf/sprTrunk

  Process resources from resgroup 7 whose
  names start with sprFlower, sprLeaf or sprTrunk


  3-gui\menu\title

  Process resources from resgroup 3 whose
  names DON'T start with gui, menu or title


  +mars/earth/mercury

  Process all resources whose names start
  with mars, earth or mercury


  -gui\menu\title

  Process all resources whose names DON'T
  start with gui, menu or title



Currently only Sprite resources and only 32bit PNG output are supported.
